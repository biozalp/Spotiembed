A simple plugin which adds an Elementor widget to usable widget library.

== Description ==

This plugin is a widget'ified version of Spotify's standart embed module. Main features:

* Able to showcase track, album, playlist and artist.
* Ability to set height within style pane of Elementor, it confronts the default values of Spotify for some content as 152px and 352px.
* Use dynamic tags in order to get the Spotify link from another source (ACF/SCF was the main focus while development)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= May I use something else aside from ACF/SCF? =

It adds the option to select from Dynamic Tag functionality of Elementor, so essentially anything passed from any plugin (other custom field plugins that I am unaware of ) or post (for instance excempt) recognized by Elementor can be used as the URL input for this plugin.

= Can I use it without custom field plugins =

The widget has it's own URL input field, so if you are not using dynamic tag, you can solely use the widget and input your URL there.

= Why there are no other styling options =

Ask Spotify, they don't let people to anything with their embed module.

== Installation ==
Get the GitHub repo in zip format and upload from "Install Plugin" pane in Wordpress Admin, or just use plugin search.
